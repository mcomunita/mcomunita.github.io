    <h2>What is the purpose of the study and what would taking part involve? </h2>
    The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of a number of digital signal processing algorithms that aim to emulate the effect of an analog dynamic range compressor. Therefore, in the course of the study, participants will be given a reference signal that corresponds to the output from the analog device. They will also be presented with four other signals that they must rate based on their notion of their quality in relation to the reference. Three of these signals come from the algorithms we intend to evaluate, while the fourth corresponds to the reference (known as the hidden reference). Participants can freely switch between the different listening examples, and can proceed or return to previous pages at their leisure. This study should take only around 10 minutes to complete and can be completed using a web browser and your personal listening device. We recommend that you use headphones, or high quality loudspeakers. 
    
    <h2>Why am I being invited?</h2>
    You are being invited to take part in this study in order to provide your opinion on the quality of audio excerpts processed by different algorithms. 
    
    <h2>Do I have to take part? </h2>
    This participant information sheet has been written to help you decide if you would like to take part. It is up to you whether you wish to take part. If you do decide to take part you will be free to withdraw at any time without needing to provide a reason, and with no penalties or detrimental effects.  
    
    <h2>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</h2>
    By participating in this study, you will be helping expand knowledge in the field of audio engineering and machine learning. 
    
    <h2>What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part? </h2>
    Potential disadvantages and risks in taking part of this survey include feeling the test is tedious and long, or exhausting your ears after a long listening session. Should this happen, you may take a break at any point or discontinue your participation in the study.
    
    <h2>Expenses and payments</h2>
    There should be no expenses or payments expected when participating in this study.
    
    <h2>What information about me will you be collecting?</h2>
    We will collect only your ratings for the different listening examples,  your experience audio engineering, and if you have any known hearing impairments.
    
    <h2>How will my data be stored and who will have access to it? </h2>
    Your data will be stored in fully anonymised format in Queen Mary University of London, and only Christian Steinmetz and Joshua Reiss will be able to access it.
    
    <h2>When and how will my data be destroyed?</h2>
    The data collected during this study will be maintained until the end of Christian Steinmetz’s PhD research, which is expected to be completed in July 2024. At that point, data relating to this study will be deleted from Queen Mary University of London’s servers.
    
    <h2>How will my data be used and shared? </h2>
    This data will be used in a journal article submission and PhD dissertation. All data will be anonymised. Data will not be accessible in open access.
    
    <h2>Under what legal basis are you collecting this information?</h2>
    Queen Mary University of London processes personal data for research purposes in accordance with the lawful basis of ‘public task’.
    Please read Queen Mary’s privacy notice for research participants containing important information about your personal data and your rights in this respect. If you have any questions relating to data protection, please contact Queen Mary’s Data Protection Officer, Queens’ Building, Mile End Road, London, E1 4NS or data-protection@qmul.ac.uk or 020 7882 7596.
    
    <h2>What will happen if I want to withdraw from this study?</h2>
    Since we will collect all data in a completely anonymous fashion, by submitting your responses at the end of the study, you agree that you will not be able to withdraw your responses at a later date. We collect very minimal data which includes soley the numerical ratings of the test stimuli as well as your responses to the general questionnaire at the end of the study. If you do not agree with this, please do not move forward with participating in this study.
    
    <h2>What should I do if I have any concerns about this study? </h2>
    If you have any concerns about the manner in which the study was conducted, in the first instance, please contact the researcher(s) responsible for the study Christian Steinmetz
    c.j.steinmetz@qmul.ac.uk. If you have a complaint which you feel you cannot discuss with the researchers then you should contact the Research Ethics Facilitators by e-mail: research-ethics@qmul.ac.uk. When contacting the Research Ethics Facilitators, please provide details of the study title, description of the study and QMERC reference number (where possible), the researcher(s) involved, and details of the complaint you wish to make.
