abstract      : "We present a lightweight method of reverse engineering distortion effects using Wiener-Hammerstein models implemented in a differentiable framework. The Wiener-Hammerstein models are formulated using graphic equalizer pre-emphasis and de-emphasis filters and a parameterized waveshaping function. Several parameterized waveshaping functions are proposed and evaluated. The performance of each method is measured both objectively and subjectively on a dataset of guitar distortion emulation software plugins and guitar audio samples."
