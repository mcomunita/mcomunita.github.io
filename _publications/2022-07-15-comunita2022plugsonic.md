abstract      : "PlugSonic is a series of web- and mobile-based applications designed to edit samples and apply audio effects (PlugSonic Sample) and create and experience dynamic and navigable soundscapes and sonic narratives (PlugSonic Soundscape). The audio processing within PlugSonic is based on the Web Audio API while the binaural rendering uses the 3D Tune-In Toolkit. Exploration of soundscapes in a physical space is made possible by adopting Apple’s ARKit. The present paper describes the implementation details, the signal processing chain and the necessary steps to curate and experience a soundscape. We also include some metrics and performance details. The main goal of PlugSonic is to give users a complete set of tools, without the need for specific devices, external software and/or hardware specialised knowledge, or custom development, with the idea that spatial audio has the potential to become a readily accessible and easy to understand technology, for anyone to adopt, whether for creative or research purposes."
