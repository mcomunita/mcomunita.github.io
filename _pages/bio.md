I am a PhD researcher in the [**Centre for Digital Music**](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) at **Queen Mary University of London** where - as a member of the [**UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in AI and Music**](https://www.aim.qmul.ac.uk/) - I am working on Audio Effects Modelling and Neural Synthesis of Sound Effects under the supervision of [**Joshua Reiss**](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~josh/).

I was research assistant in the [**Audio Experience Design Lab**](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/design-engineering/research/audio-experience-design/) at **Imperial College London**, working with [**Lorenzo Picinali**](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/l.picinali) on 3D audio and headphones acoustics.

I have a past as guitar amplifiers designer and project engineer for [**Blackstar Amps**](https://www.blackstaramps.com/uk), where I had fun with high-voltage valve amps, low-voltage amps and pedals, as well as helping to model analogue circuits.

Back in Italy, I used to design and hand-build [overdrive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shVymc6jDc8&t=71s) and [distortion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcvmgSm_9xI) pedals as [**Mad Hatter Stompboxes**](http://www.effectsdatabase.com/model/madhatter#pictures)

I hold a BEng in Computer Engineering and an MEng in Electronic Engineering from [**Sapienza University of Rome**](https://www.uniroma1.it/en) and an MSc in Sound and Music Computing from [**Queen Mary University of London**](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/).
